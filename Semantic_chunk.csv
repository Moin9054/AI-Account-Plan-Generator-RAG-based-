"Adaptive Account Planning Framework
How to Use This Framework
This framework adapts to two dimensions:
Account Planning Depth: How much planning does this account need?
Planning Help Level: How much guidance do you want in thinking through each section?"
"Step 1: Determine Your Account Planning Depth
Answer these questions about the account:
Strategic Importance (Choose one):
 Tier 1: Top 10% of accounts by revenue OR high growth potential OR strategic reference value
 Tier 2: Solid performing accounts with moderate growth opportunity
 Tier 3: Smaller accounts or mature accounts with limited growth potential
Complexity (Choose one):
 High: Multiple decision-makers, long sales cycles, complex solution set, or significant risk
 Medium: Some complexity in relationships or solutions, but manageable
 Low: Straightforward relationship and solution set
Current Status (Choose one):
 At Risk: Facing competitive pressure, relationship issues, or declining revenue
 Growth Opportunity: Clear potential to expand significantly
 Stable: Performing as expected, no major concerns or opportunities
Recommended Planning Depth:
Choose COMPREHENSIVE planning if:
Account is Tier 1, OR
Account is at risk (any tier), OR
Account has high complexity + growth opportunity
Choose GUIDED planning if:
Account is Tier 2 with medium complexity, OR
Account is Tier 1 but stable and low complexity
Choose STREAMLINED planning if:
Account is Tier 3 with low complexity and stable
Override this recommendation if your judgment differs - you know your accounts better than any rubric."
"Step 2: Select Your Planning Help Level
Streamlined Help: You're confident and want just the key questions (2-3 prompts per section)
Guided Help: You want moderate support to think through each area (4-5 prompts per section)
Comprehensive Help: You want extensive guidance and diagnostic questions (6-8 prompts per section)

Warning Check
 If you've selected Streamlined Planning for a Tier 1 account: Are you sure? Strategic accounts typically benefit from deeper planning.
 If you've selected Comprehensive Planning for a stable Tier 3 account: Consider whether this level of planning is the best use of your time."

"PLANNING PROMPTS: Account Overview
STREAMLINED HELP (2-3 prompts):
What makes this account different from your other accounts? What do they care about that others don't?
Is your revenue trend with them up, down, or flat? What does that tell you about your position?
Is your revenue target realistic based on history, or does it require a fundamentally different relationship?
GUIDED HELP (4-5 prompts):
What makes this account different from your other accounts? What do they care about that others don't?
Looking at your financial history with them - is the trend up, down, or flat? What does that pattern tell you about your position with them?
Review your past key projects - what types of problems have they hired you to solve? Is there a pattern in the work you do for them?
Is your coming year revenue target realistic based on history, or does it require a different type of relationship or offering?
If you had to describe this account in one sentence to a colleague, what would you say?
COMPREHENSIVE HELP (6-8 prompts):
What makes this account strategically different from others? Consider: their business model, decision-making style, what they value, how they buy.
Looking at your financial history - what's the trend line (up/down/flat) and what's the volatility (steady or erratic)? What does each tell you?
Review your past key projects with fresh eyes - categorize them by type (strategic vs tactical, proactive vs reactive, complex vs simple). What pattern emerges?
What's your profitability/margin trend with this account? Are you becoming more or less profitable with them over time, and why?
Is your revenue target realistic based on trajectory, or does it require a fundamentally different relationship? If it's a stretch, what specifically needs to change?
Who are the 3-5 people who most influence whether you win, grow, or lose with this account? Do you have strong relationships with all of them?
If this account fired you tomorrow, what would they say was the reason? If they doubled their spend with you, what would be the catalyst?
On a scale of 1-10, how well do you understand their strategic priorities for the coming year? What would you need to know to get to a 10?"
"Section 2: Last Year Assessment
This section appears in all planning depths
What Happened Last Year
Completed Initiatives/Projects:
Initiatives Not Completed (and why):
Hits (What went better than expected):
Misses (What went worse than expected):
Key Lessons:"
"PLANNING PROMPTS: Last Year Assessment
STREAMLINED HELP (2-3 prompts):
Be honest: What did you commit to last year that didn't happen? Why not?
What surprised you (good or bad) about how this account performed?
If you could redo one decision with this account from last year, what would it be?
GUIDED HELP (4-5 prompts):
Looking at your completed vs. not completed initiatives - is there a pattern in what didn't happen? (Lack of time, their delays, our capacity, misaligned priorities?)
Your ""hits"" - what did you do that created those wins? Can you replicate that approach?
Your ""misses"" - be brutally honest: Were these in your control or theirs? What could you have done differently?
What surprised you (positive or negative) about this account's behavior last year?
If you were coaching a colleague on this account, what's the one lesson you'd emphasize?
COMPREHENSIVE HELP (6-8 prompts):
Review your completed initiatives - which were strategic vs. tactical? Did you spend your time where you intended?
Looking at initiatives not completed - categorize by reason (our capacity, their delays, priorities changed, relationship issues, external factors). What's the primary pattern?
Your ""hits"" - dig deeper: What capabilities did you demonstrate? What relationships did you strengthen? What did they learn about you that they didn't know before?
Your ""misses"" - distinguish between execution misses (we didn't deliver what we promised) vs. strategic misses (we pursued the wrong opportunities). Which predominates?
What surprised you most about this account's behavior, decisions, or priorities last year? What does that tell you about how well you understand their business?
Compare your revenue target from last year to actual results - if there's a gap, what were the 2-3 primary reasons?
Did your relationship with key decision-makers strengthen, weaken, or stay the same last year? What specific evidence supports that assessment?
If you could redo your account strategy from last year knowing what you know now, what would you change? (Be specific - don't just say ""pay more attention"")"
"Section 3: Strategic Position Diagnosis
This section appears in GUIDED and COMPREHENSIVE planning depth
(For STREAMLINED planning depth, skip to Section 4)
Your Current Position
Where do you live in their world? (Check the one that best describes your primary position)
 Tactical Vendor: They call us for specific tasks, price-focused, project-by-project
 Preferred Provider: They call us first, but still project-by-project thinking
 Strategic Partner: Integrated into their planning, relationship with leadership
 Trusted Advisor: Consulted on strategy, deep relationships across functions
For which specific functions or leaders does this apply? (Are you different things to different parts of their organization?)

Your Growth Constraint
What's the primary factor limiting your growth with this account? (Pick ONE)
 Relationship Breadth: We know too few people; single point of failure
 Relationship Depth: They know us but don't trust us with bigger problems
 Capability Awareness: They don't understand full scope of what we can do
 Value Perception: They see us as tactical/commodity, not strategic
 Strategic Misalignment: What they need next isn't our strength
 Competitive Pressure: Someone else is winning the expansion opportunities
 Organizational Constraints: Their budget, politics, or structure limits growth
 Wallet Share Exhaustion: We've legitimately captured what's available
Evidence supporting this diagnosis:
What have you tried that worked or didn't work?:

Strategic Implication
Given this diagnosis, what needs to change for you to grow?"
"PLANNING PROMPTS: Strategic Position Diagnosis
GUIDED HELP (4-5 prompts):
On Your Position:
If your main contact left tomorrow, how many other people in the account would advocate for you? What does that number tell you?
Are you invited into their planning conversations, or do they come to you with pre-determined needs?
Do they see you as someone who executes their ideas, or someone who shapes their thinking?
Is your position the same across all parts of their organization, or are you a trusted advisor in one area but a vendor in another?
On Your Constraint: 5. Looking at opportunities you didn't win last year - was there a common pattern in why? (That pattern is likely your constraint)
COMPREHENSIVE HELP (6-8 prompts):
On Your Position:
Map the key decision-makers and influencers - for each person, how would they describe your role? (""They're our vendor for X"" vs. ""They're our partner in solving Y"" vs. ""They help us think through Z"")
When was the last time they asked your opinion before making a decision (vs. asking you to implement a decision already made)? What does the frequency tell you?
Do they introduce you to their customers, partners, or board? If yes, how do they describe you? If no, why not?
Compare your relationship with the executive team vs. operational team - is there a gap? Which relationship is stronger and why?
If they were choosing between you and a competitor for a major new project, what would be the deciding factors? Would it be price, relationship, capability, or something else?
On Your Constraint: 6. Review every expansion opportunity you pursued last year that didn't close - what was the stated reason vs. the likely real reason? The pattern reveals your constraint. 7. If your primary constraint is relationships (breadth or depth), which specific relationship is the highest leverage to develop? If it's perception or awareness, what proof point would change their view? 8. Is your growth constraint different in different parts of their organization? (You might have a relationship problem with Finance but a capability awareness problem with Operations)"

Are they in growth mode or efficiency mode? What evidence supports that? (Hiring, capital investment, messaging, etc.)
What's their competitive position in their market? Are they a leader defending position, a challenger trying to grow share, or a niche player specializing? How does their position affect what they need from vendors?
